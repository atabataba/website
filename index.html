        <p>
          Chop and Carry Farm is emerging as a Soto Zen practice community, guided by the teachings
          of Dōgen and Suzuki Roshi, with its practice setting modeled on the early days of
          Tassajara. This center is not for priest training. It’s a place to practice ethical living
          based on Dōgen’s Hachi Dainin Gaku and the teachings of the Shōbōgenzō, especially the
          Genjōkōan.
        </p>

        <p>
          The community stays small and aligned with what the island can support. Individual dwellings
          follow traditional Buddhist ten-cubit proportions. Daily life is built around minimizing
          dependence on fossil fuels, eating and creating locally, and staying honest about the limits
          of the land and what it can sustain.
        </p>

        <p>
          This project is a shared effort to live responsibly with one another and with the land.
          Anyone who resonates with this intention is welcome to help shape what is coming into form.

          <p>
            Paul Zengyu Discoe began studying with Shunryu Suzuki Roshi in 1967 and was ordained
            by him in 1970 alongside Reb Anderson. Suzuki Roshi then sent him to Japan to study
            traditional temple building. While there, he lived in rural villages among farmers,
            artisans, and priests, away from Japan’s growing industrial centers.
          </p>

          <p>
            This experience showed him the simple, self-sufficient economy of pre-war rural
            Japan. The way people lived and worked together left a lasting impression and is a
            major influence behind Chop and Carry Farm.
          </p>

          <p>
            After returning to the United States, Paul devoted his craft to supporting the Zen
            community. His work includes Greens Restaurant in San Francisco, the Abbot’s House at
            Green Gulch, Founders Hall and the new Zendo at Tassajara, and other projects. In
            1990, after receiving transmission, he founded Joinery Structures, designing and
            building spaces for both Buddhist and secular use.
          </p>

          <p>
            His reflections on decades of practice appear in
            <em>Zen Architecture</em>, a book that looks at building as an expression of the
            spirit of the Genjōkōan.
