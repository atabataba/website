This center is not for priest training. It is a place to practice ethical living based on Dōgen Zenji’s Hachi Dainin Gaku and his teachings of the Shōbōgenzō, especially the Genjōkōan. </p> <p> The community is intended to remain small and in harmony with what the island can support. Individual dwellings follow traditional Buddhist ten-cubit proportions. Daily life is built around minimizing dependence on fossil fuels, eating and creating locally, and working within the limits of the island and what it can sustain. </p> <p> This project is a shared effort to live responsibly with one another and with the land. Anyone who resonates with this intention is welcome to help shape what is coming into form. </p> <div class="mission
